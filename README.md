# Projects from the Programming Technology 1 and 2 Courses  
Complutense University of Madrid  

This repository includes the projects developed for the **Programming Technology 1 (TP1)** and **Programming Technology 2 (TP2)** courses at the Complutense University of Madrid.

## TP1 - Space Invaders  
The **TP1** project is a basic implementation of the classic **Space Invaders** video game, developed in Java. The game features:  

- Difficulty level configuration: **EASY**, **NORMAL**, or **HARD**.  
- An optional seed input for reproducible random element generation.  
- Interactive gameplay through a console-based controller.  

### Learning Objectives:
This project focuses on applying structured programming concepts, handling input and output in a console-based environment, and managing game states effectively.

## TP2 - Animal Ecosystem  
The **TP2** project is a simulation of an **Animal Ecosystem**, where animals, regions, and environmental rules interact dynamically. The project was developed in Java and features the following:  

- **Customizable ecosystem size**: Configure the grid dimensions of the ecosystem.  
- **Animal behaviors**: Includes movement, reproduction, and interaction (e.g., predation).  
- **Dynamic regions**: Simulate environmental zones with specific rules.  
- **Selection strategies**: Animals use strategies such as selecting the closest, the first, or the youngest entity for interaction.  
- **Multiple execution modes**:
  - **Batch Mode**: Runs the simulation without a graphical interface.
  - **GUI Mode**: Allows visualization and interaction through a graphical interface.

### Learning Objectives:
This project emphasizes the application of **object-oriented programming** principles, including:  
- Class hierarchies and interfaces.  
- Factory and Builder design patterns.  
- Effective use of external libraries (e.g., JSON handling and CLI parsing).  
- Integration of both batch and graphical execution models.

### Example Features:
- Simulation of predator-prey dynamics (e.g., wolves hunting sheep).  
- Regions with resource constraints that affect animal behavior.  
- Configurable simulation time and step durations.
